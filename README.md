# cricket-player-performance-dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI project that analyzes cricket batting performance metrics. The dashboard visualizes player-level statistics such as matches, innings, runs, highest score (HS), batting average, balls faced (BF), strike rate (SR), centuries (100), half-centuries (50), ducks (0), and boundary counts (4s, 6s).
